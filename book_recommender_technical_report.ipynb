    "#### Problem Statement:\n",
    "Finding new books for children to read that they will enjoy and which are at an appropriate reading level is a challenge faced by educators and parents alike. I would like to help address this problem by building a recommender system based upon the reading level and subject matter of a book that the child has already read and liked.\n",
    "\n",
    "I pulled my data from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page), which is a site that offers over 53,000 free ebooks. This ended up limiting the useage of my recommender to just books within Project Gutenberg. All of the books that are offered are free because their copyright has expired in the United States, which means that the I cannot offer recommendations for modern books. However, my pipeline would work with modern books if they did become available to me."

    "### 1. Introduction and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to properly understand and enjoy a text, and thus continue to develop as a reader, it is important for children to have access to books that are both interesting and engaging for them and within their [Zone of Proximal Development](https://www.soe.vt.edu/tandl/pdf/Mesmer/Presentation_Mesmer_VSRA_2008_MatchingKids.pdf). \n",
    "\n",
    "The Zone of Proximal Development, usually abbreviated as ZPD, is a concept describes what a child can do on their own, what they can do with help, and what is beyond their ability. In reading development, we want to ensure that children are both accurately reading the words and that they are comprehending what they are reading, or else they will become frustrated with the text. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reading Levels\n",
    "\n",
    "A big part of my recommendation engine is based upon reading level, of which there are many different measures. I wanted to ensure that the texts being recommended were within the ZPD of the reader so I needed to find a way to quantify the gap between what the reader can and cannot read. Some reading levels work with formulas based upon word length and sentence length and others also take into account word difficulty and lists of grade level words. I have chosen to use [Flesch Kincaid Grade Level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests) for the measure of reading level metric in this project. I made this choice because it is a widely accepted measure that is also directly calculable without importing lists of grade level words. I was wary of using lists of grade level words considering that most of the books in my dataset were written well before the current standards of grade level words and I want to be able to compare books accross different time periods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Flesch Kincaid grade level is calculated using the following formula: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$0.39\\left(\\frac{\\text{total words}}{\\text{total sentences}}\\right)+11.8\\left(\\frac{\\text{total syllables}}{\\text{total words}}\\right)-15.59$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting number corresponds somewhat to what grade level the child is in in school, though in reality students can vary widely in reading level within each grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another realated measure called the Flesch reading-ease test, in which higher scores indicate material that is easier to read; lower numbers mark passages that are more difficult to read. Scores above 90 indicate that the text is very easy to read and can be easily understood by an average 11-year-old student. Scores below 30 indicate that the text is very difficult to read and best understood by university graduates. The formula for Flesch reading ease is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$206.835-1.015\\left(\\frac{\\text{total words}}{\\text{total sentences}}\\right)-84.6\\left(\\frac{\\text{total syllables}}{\\text{total words}}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end I chose to use the Flesch Kincaid grade level metric as it was more intuitive to have the reading level go up as the difficulty level of the book went up. I did calculate both of these reading levels for each book. From this point forward when I refer to reading level I will mean Flesch Kincaid grade level. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Recommender System\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic premise of my recommender system was to take as input the title of a book that the reader recently enjoyed reading and to output a list of recommended books. I did this by first obtaining a subset the library of available books to only include books that were within the ZPD of the reader. This was determined by finding the reading level of the book that the reader enjoyed and returning books that were within an acceptable range of reading levels close to the book they entered in. I determined this to be between one grade level below and one quarter of a grade level above the book they entered in, after reading research about reading level and ZPD. Depending on the book, this usually narrowed down the books available to between one and three thousand, sometimes more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once I had a subset of acceptable books, I determined how similar the subject matter of the books were using the Jaccard Similarity of the lists of subjects that were determined by the person who submitted the text to Project Gutenberg. However, I also wanted to compare the actual text of the books to each other, so I found the cosine distances between the count vectorized texts of the books to each other as well as the cosine distances of the tf-idf vectorized texts of the books to each other. This gave me three different measures of text similarity, which I will compare in the analysis section below.\n"

Indeed, as can be seen from the heatmap of a subset of the cosine similarity of the count vectorized books and tfidf books (the same books in each) that the tfidf books showed more similarity overall than the count vectorized books. However, there are a few books which stand out particularly clearly in the count vectorized heatmaps.\n",
